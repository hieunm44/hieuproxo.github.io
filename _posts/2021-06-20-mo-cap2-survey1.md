* A comprehensive survey of CV-based human motion capture literature from 1980 to 2000
* Focus on a general overview based on a taxonomy of system functionalities
* Four processes: Initialization, Tracking, Pose Estimation, and Recognition 


# __1. Introduction__
* Human motion capture: head, arms, torso, and legs
* Definition of _motion capture_: The process of capturing the large scale body movements of a subject at some resolution

## 1.1 Application Areas
Three major application areas:
* Surveillance: parking lot
* Control: games, virtual environments, animation, control of remotely located implements
* Analysis: diagnostics of orthopedic patients, improvement of performance of athletes

## 1.2 Alternative Technologies for Motion Capture
* Two subsystems: sensing and processing
* Trade-off between active sensing and passive sensing:

|        Active Sensing        |           Passive Sensing          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Place devices on the subject | Is based on “natural” signal sources  |
| Simpler processing           | Use computer vision for processing |
| Apps: analysis, control      | Apps: surveillance, control        |

* CV allows in principle for touchfree and more discrete “pure”
motion capture systems.

## 1.3 Content of This Paper
* Is only concerned with CV-based approaches, i.e. passive sensing
* Survey of publications in CV-based human motion capture from 1980 to 2000


# __2. Surveys and Taxonomies__ 
## 2.1 Previous Surveys
## 2.2 A Taxonomy Based on Functionalities
* Functional structure of a comprehensive motion capture system:
